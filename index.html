                    I was born in Phoenix, Arizona, but I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma. When I entered high school, my family moved to Alaska. I graduated from 
                    high school there and got my associate's degree in Computer Electronics. I enjoy playing video games, as well as watching tv. I like the                      enjoyment the stories are able to bring out. That is what I hope to do in the future. To be apart of the people to bring enjoyment to other people.
